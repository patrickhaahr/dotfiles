# My Arch Linux & Hyprland Dotfiles üêß

![A placeholder image of a desktop setup. Replace this with a screenshot of your desktop!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme/master/Previews/jake_the_dog.png)

Welcome to my personal configuration for a highly customized, aesthetic, and performant Arch Linux desktop environment. This setup is built around **Hyprland** and is designed for both software development and gaming on a modern Wayland stack.

The entire installation process is automated via a single script, which handles package installation, theming, and dotfile symlinking with **GNU Stow**.

## üöÄ Installation

> **Warning:** This installation script is tailored to **my specific hardware and software preferences** (Arch Linux, AMD hardware). It will install numerous packages and overwrite system configuration files. Please read the `install.sh` script to understand what it does before running it. Use at your own risk!

### Prerequisites

-   A fresh Arch Linux installation.
-   `git` and `base-devel` packages installed.

### Automated Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/patrickhaahr/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```sh
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the installation script:**
    ```sh
    ./install.sh
    ```

The script will handle everything:
-   Installing packages from official repositories and the AUR.
-   Setting up GRUB, Plymouth, and SDDM themes.
-   Configuring system services.
-   Using `stow` to symlink all the configuration files from this repository into your home directory.

---

## üîß Post-Installation & Usage

### Stow Management

This repository uses **GNU Stow** to manage symlinks. The `install.sh` script runs this for you initially, but you can manage packages individually later.

-   **To stow a package (e.g., nvim):**
    ```sh
    stow nvim
    ```
-   **To unstow a package:**
    ```sh
    stow -D nvim
    ```
-   **To restow everything:**
    ```sh
    stow -R *
    ```

### Change Default Shell

If Zsh is not your default shell after the script finishes, you can set it manually:
```sh
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

### Reboot
A reboot is recommended to ensure all services (SDDM, Plymouth, etc.) are loaded correctly.
